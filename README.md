## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AryanKhokhar1/Python_PracticeSet.git
   cd Python_PracticeSet
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired directory:**

   ```sh
   cd basics
   ```

3. **Run the Python program:**

   ```sh
   python hello_world.py
   ```

Repeat the above steps for any other program you want to run. Make sure to navigate to the correct directory and replace `hello_world.py` with the name of the program you wish to run.
